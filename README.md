XMLToParcelable
==========

This library creates Parcelable Java Classes directly from XML.

#Â How to use?

Import this project into your IDE and run it as a Java project.
It will ask for a package name and a XML String or URL.

As a result it will generate parcelable Java classes (in the output folder) that you can use directly in your Android projects thus reducing the amount of boilerplate code you need to write.
